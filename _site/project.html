	          <h6>Overview</h6>
                  
                  How can we control a car by only camera? The idea of
                  behavior cloning is to replicate the driving performance
                  of human by using machine learning whose model uses the
                  camera data as feature(input) and the steering angle as
                  label(output).
                  
                  <br>
                  Obviously, deep learning is the first model that
                  could be used for this task.　The deep learning
                  model I used is almost same as NVIDIA's self-driving
                  car, 5 convolutional layers and 4 full connected
                  layers. Plus, I did data augmentation and hyper
                  parameter tuning, which is the hardest part of deep
                  learning work, I believe.
                  
                  <br>
                  This project was part of the Udacity's Self-driving
                  Engineer course. While it was super fun to let my
                  model run on simultaion, there are tons of things to
                  achieve better performance of deep learning model.

                  Using the three cameras (assuming the dash cam) as
                  input, the objective of this project is to predict
                  the steering angle so that the car does not deviate
                  from the course. The challenging part is where curve
                  is sharp and the side lane is missing. Data
                  augmentaion, data preprocessing and deep learning
                  model are tweaked trial and error.

                  <br>
                  The velocity control is done by simple PI
                  controller.

                  The model I used for this task is the NVIDIA's
                  self-driving car model which has 5 convolutional
                  layers and 4 full connected layers. This ended up
                  about 3 million parameter to my case.
                  
                  <br>
                  The three images from cameras are simply augmented
                  by flipping. The preprocess is just simple gray
                  scale converstion + cropping. I spent a while for
                  trial and error with various preprocess such as
                  blurring, canny edge detection, contrast adjustment,
                  but the simple gray works best for now.

	          One of the result is shown in the right movie. It
	          successfully completes one lap of the
	          course. Obviously, this simulation uses new data
	          (test data), so this can adapt to new dataset of
	          this course.
                  
                  <br>
                  What if the course is changed? The idea of behavior
                  cloning requires different dataset to secure the
                  driving perfomrance. However, this tranied model
                  could be helpful when transfer learning is used for
                  new course. There is one more challenging different
                  track in Udacity's simulator where it has uphill and
                  downhills. This 2nd course is the one in which even
                  human feels difficulties to control the car. I will
                  try it later on.

	          <h6>Overview</h6>
	          Prius Challenge was the racing competition about
	          maximizing mpg for Prius by data-driven strategy.  This
	          involves both data science(theory) and real driving
	          skills(practice).

	          I applied both two different machine learning approaches
	          to identify the best strategy to achieve higher mpg. The
	          analysis revealed, for example, where to use
	          'neutral'/'drive' or 'EVmode(on/off)'.

	          As a result, our team got the award of 'Best MPG by
	          Machine Learning'! Plus, we achieved 83mpg(w/o
	          penalties), while Toyota dream team did 86mpg. Yeah, we
	          were so close and I can say data-driven approach worked!
	          
	          This competition was held at Sonoma Raceway by Toyota
	          Research Institute in Mar 3rd, 2017. Our team was
	          composed of me(data scientist) and 4 other members of
	          great drivers!

	          <b>Q1. How do we identify best strategy to maximize mpg?</b>
	          Given the dataset, it is required to identify how use inputs (throttle, brake, gear and EV-mode)

	          <br>
	          
	          <b>Q2. How does data scientist deliver the strategy to drivers?</b>
	          This is not only data analytics but also teamwork. Delivering the result to driver is key part.

	          <br>

                  <br>
                  
                  Applying clustering technique to gps information, I have
                  divided the race track into 150 pieces.  Then, I
                  visualized the average and variance of the 4
                  inputs(gear, brake, throttle, ev-mode) using
                  high-performance dataset (top 30% mpg data) and
                  low-performance dataset (Bottom 30% mpg data). This
                  visualization helps driver to undersntand the strategy
                  of how they use 4 inputs to get higher mpg. 

                  <br>
                  
	          <b>2. Understanding remarkable point</b>

                  <br>
                  
                  Using 600 features (4inputs x 150 locations) and mpg
                  data as the label, supervised learning is applied. Then,
                  the feature importance is applied to identify the
                  important inputs which highly affect mpg. In other
                  words, they are the remakable points that drivers specially consider.

                  As for competition result, we achieved 83mpg on average
                  for 9 laps(42:29). We did great job! We were so close to
                  Toyota dream team(86mpg) who are the most knowledable

	          <h6>Overview</h6>

                  This research discusses how data analytics on muscle use
                  in extreme racing conditions can be conducted to find
                  actionable insights for the driver One of the important
                  insights is how to minimize driver’s muscle fatigue
                  during a race, because IndyCar has regulations
                  forbidding the use of power steering. This research
                  tackles two technological challenges: 1. data validation
                  on noisy signal obtained from wearable device in extreme
                  condition, 2. data cultivation to find actionable
                  insights for the driver from heterogeneous racing
                  data. First, we propose a data quality assessment
                  technique, enabling the judgment of whether data is
                  reliable or not. This qualitative analysis revealed that
                  the data validation method works 99.5% accuracy to
                  classify data as reliable or not. Second, we propose a
                  data visualization tool based on unsupervised learning
                  that enables the driver or mechanics to discover useful
                  feedback. We identified and demonstrated several
                  actionable insights, e.g., identifying potential
                  relaxation points.

	          The driver's challenge and data science's challenges are
	          shown in the right figure.

	          <br><br>
	          
	          Yeah, this may sound the straightforward problem
	          statement though, it was not easy to setup this problem
	          indeed.

	          First, I had f2f conversation with Tony Kanaan to
	          discuss his real challenges. (design thinking process)
	          While most of them were hard to solve due to the lack of
	          the dataset, some sounded feasible to me. Then, once I
	          started data analytics and had discussion with various
	          people, I realized the necessity of the data validation
	          process.

	          Like this project, innovation works are occasionally
	          hard to define job contents at first. To me, the hard
	          challenges of this projects are 1. clarifying the
	          problem statement and 2. collecting the unique dataset.

	          <h6>Solution</h6>

                  The idea of the data validation is that the actual
                  sensor data is considered as unreliable data if the
                  difference betweeen actual and predicted value are
                  big. The prediction model uses car-telemetry data as
                  features and predict the EMG value. This aims for
                  prediction model to avoid the bad effect of noisy EMG
                  values.

	          <br>
	          
	          Data cultivation uses the unsupervised learning for
	          driver or mechanics to understand tremendous data in
	          more intuitive way.

	          <br>

	          In additino to data analytics, I also created data
	          visualization WebUI for them. Data validation is shown
	          in real-time dashboard and data cultivation is shown in
	          post analytics dashboard.

                  <h6>Result</h6>

	          The data validation model has 99.48% accuracy to
	          classify whether the EMG sensor data is reliable or
	          unreliable. Yeah, it has good performance. (Please see
	          the details on my paper.)
	          
                  <br>

	          The data cultivation identified the locations where
	          driver tends to have unstable muscle use and where
	          driver can take rest more. This may be feedback for the
	          driver to avoid muscle cramp.

                  What if a drone loses one control input by accident
	          while flying? Since a ordinal drone system has 4 inputs,

                       This paper reveals the minimal number of inputs for
                       hovering control from the perspective of nonlinear
                       control system theory. Then, a nonlinear controller is
                       designed to obtain meaningful motion for an

                       limitation acknowledged through the model
                       analysis. Throughout this paper, a particular UAV model
                       having three rotors is considered as a controlled
                       object. First, nonlinear state equations are computed
                       with valid assumptions. Next, the model analysis reveals
                       that hovering control is impossible for not only the

                  I identified the dimension of the equlibria submanifold

                  is impossible to flying without counter rotation of
                  the body due to law of action and reaction. In
                  reality, toys usually has two rotor to cancel this
                  effect. Yeah, it sounds definitely impossible to

                  This research proposes a nonlinear controller
                  realizing periodic motion to MonoRotor type flying
                  robot having no equilibrium point. The control
                  target is semi-hovering; a motion that passes a
                  desired non-equilibrium point at which position and
                  attitude stop periodically. In order to achieve this
                  control objective, we propose discontinuous and
                  time-varying output zeroing controller which ends up
                  controlling Zero Dynamics. The numerical simulation
                  and stability analysis show the validity of the
                  suggesting controller design method.

                  The Monorotor system has structural underactuation,
                  since the number of input is less than the number of
                  states. (two states : posture and height, one input
                  : single rotor) In addition, Monorotor robot does
                  not own the equilibrium point. Because of these
                  properties, the only way to realize the meaningful
                  motion is semi-hovering, which is a periodic motion
                  that passes at the desired non-equilibrium point in
                  each cycle. Thus, this control objective requires
                  Zero Dynamics to be controlled. The main
                  contribution of this research is the controller
                  design that results in controlling Zero Dynamics.

                  <b>Discrete Output Zeroing </b>
                  The strategy to realize semi-hovering has the
                  following two steps. 1st step controls posture, then
                  2nd step controls height. The key idea is that the
                  2nd step, height control, needs to be done with
                  maintaining 1st step goal. When designing output
                  zeroing control to control posture, one parameter is
                  free parameter which is the frequency of the rotor.
                  Changing the frequency results in different height.
                  Wisely changing the free parameter, frequency,
                  enables to control height! In this case, height
                  becomes zero dynamics when 1st step is
                  realized. Thus, this method can control zero
                  dynamics discretely.

                  Acrobot is two-link manipulator which has only one
                  input (motor) between these links. This system is
                  called 'underactuated system', because the number of
                  input is less than the number of states.  This
                  research aims for jumping and landing motion control
                  for Acrobot.

                  While linear approximation control works in limited
                  conditions, nonlinear controller gives more flexible
                  and stable performance. Especially, this is very
                  interesting research topic, as the controller
                  utilizes 'unstable' zero dynamics for jumping and
                  'stable' zero dynamics for landing phase.

	          <h6>Solution</h6>
                  As a control strategy, I defined 5 different phase.
                  1. transition phase aims for changing posture for
                  jumping 2. jumping phase aims for jumping off from
                  ground 3. flying phase aims for changin posture for
                  landing phase 4. impact phase provides strong
                  external force.  5. landing phase aims for
                  stabilizing acrobot again.
                  
                  At phase 1 and 5, controller uses output zeroing
                  whose output fuction is based on angular
                  momentum. Using this method makes Zero Dynamics
                  stable.
                  
                  At phase 2, controller uses output zeroing whose
                  output fuction is based on the direction of flying
                  path. Using this method makes Zero Dynamics
                  unstable.

                  In simulation, it successfully goes through five
                  different phases and suceeded in flying and landing.

                  In experiment, both flying phase and landing phase
                  went well. In this experiment, we used the air table
                  to realize the half gravity situation. This air
                  table has a bunch of tiny holes which blow
                  compressed air to make Acrobot levitate from the
                  board. These effect of air may not be small enough
                  to neglect. Thus, more robust controller would be
                  needed.

                  way.  But they tend to last long and give me special
                  feeling, affection.
                  
                  <br>

	          <h6>My lifelong speaker, maybe</h6>
                  
                  This time, I made speaker, the simple model of bass
                  reflex. Making speaker means here is to design a box to
                  maximize the performance of a speaker unit. This work
                  was great and I still love them: design, texture and, of
                  course, the sound quality. The color and speaker unit
                  have been 'aged' and will be classical until I die. :D
                  Now, I need to protect them from my baby's poking. But
                  even if it is broken by accident, I am sure I will
                  repair them and get more affection to it. 
                  
                  <br>

	          <h6>The steps</h6>
                  Here is the summary of the steps
                  <ol type="I">
                    <li>Decide the speaker unit</li>

                    Depending on the limitation of your space and the
                    requirement of sound quality and your budget, you may
                    want to decide the speaker unit first. If needed,
                    tweeter should be added for better performance for
                    high frequency sound.

                    In Japanese, this place is very helpful. You may want
                    to Akihabara to get feedback from the most
                    knowledgable people.
                    <a href="http://www.koizumi-musen.com/">Koizumi Musen
                    </a>
                    
                    <li>Design the box</li>

                    A bass reflex system (also known as a ported, vented
                    box or reflex port) is a type of loudspeaker enclosure
                    that uses a port (hole) or vent cut into the cabinet
                    and a section of tubing or pipe affixed to the
                    port. (from wikipedia) Thus, the size of the
                    enclosure(bos), the hole affect the quality of the
                    sound.  This should be designed depending on the
                    specification of the speaker unit that you chose.

                    In
                    Japanese, <a href="http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~ab6s-med/NORTH/SP/bassreff.htm">
                      this site </a> may help to design the enclosure(box).

                    
                    <li>Go to home center and get materials</li>

                    There are various woods. Every woods have different
                    characteristics. Stiff is said to be better, but I
                    chose the wood by the texture and my budget. You may
                    want to pay attention to the direction of the grain.
                    Do not forget to get the acoustical material, which
                    should be attached to insider of the speaker. Plus,
                    you need to get wiring cable and terminal for it.
                    
                    <li>Assemble the materials and paint</li> You just
                    need to assemble them. I am not writing details here,
                    but just create whatever you want. If you make any
                    mistake, that is part of your memory and it will
                    become the reason why you feel affection, maybe.
                    
                    <li>Test(aging)</li> Some people talk about aging. To
                    me, it sounds like urban legend...  The idea of the
                    aging is that the more you use the speaker, the better
                    quality sound you can experience. Some people play
                    music for several days, which makes the speaker unit
                    adapts the design of the enclosure you designed.

                    <br>
                    
                    However, I personally do not think my sense of hearing
                    quality is good enough to distinguish very slight but
                    important difference of music...

	          <h6>Overview</h6> I have played basketball since I was 6
                  years old. As I love it, I joined to
	          <a href="http://www.sloansportsconference.com/activities/hackathon/">
		    MIT Sloan Sports
		    Analytics Hackathon
	          </a> hosted by ESPN in Mar.2017. The theme of the
                  hackathon was "Measure the unmeasureable in basketball"
                  such as teamwork, mentality, leadership and heart. Yeah,
                  sounds very tough. This is specifically hard task as a
                  data science task, because there are no ground truth of
                  these factors...

	          <br>
	          
                  For this hackathon, I decided to focus on 'loose ball
                  detection'. In basketball, loose ball is the moment
                  audience can fell player's fighting spirits. Not only
                  that, chasing loose ball has chance to 1. excite
                  audience, 2. inspire teammates and 3. change momentum of
                  the game.
	          <br>
                  
                  Conventionally in the given dataset by ESPN (as far as I
                  thoroughly surveyed), the loose ball has not been
                  recorded unless it is related to foul. Thus, finding
                  loose ball automatically would be helpful to understand
                  player's latent power of mentality.

	          <b>Q. How is it possible to detect loose ball?</b>
	          Chasing loose ball could be one of the important actions
	          to tell player's fighting spirits. However, the loose
	          ball is not recorded in stats. Moreover, there may not
	          be well-defined definition of loose ball in literature.

	          <br>
	          
	          The given dataset includes the both ball and players
	          trajectory. Thus, the challenge is how to define the
	          loose ball in mathematical formulation.

                <div class="col-md-6">
	          <h6>Solution</h6>

	          The left figure desribes my approach to detect loose
	          ball.  Based on observational definittion, the
	          mathematical formulation was set up. If the trajectory
	          data satisfies all of the conditions at certain moment,
	          then the moment can be the time somebody is chasing
	          loose ball.

	          <br>

	          Now, this is a merely heuristic approach. Once the
	          labeled data of loose ball is available, I should apply
	          the supervised learning appoach. Maybe, this is typical
	          type of deep learning task!

                  <h6>Result</h6>

	          Based on the above rule-based approach, the right movie
	          shows one of the example of the loose ball. Here, you can see
	          two of each team members chase the ball.

	          There are 180+ applicants to this hackathon, and I was
	          chosen for the 40 participants! Unfortunately, I could
	          not make it to finalist this time. (First time to miss
	          the award in hackathon!) It looked like the host, ESPN,
	          wanted to know more creative idea, not cool software
	          implementation. I learned that competing sports industry
	          is very hard unless you have really deep knowledge about
	          that sports. Even though my hobby is basketball, my
	          creativity about basketball may not be enough to satisfy
	          ESPN.

                  I participated in Mercedes Benz Hackathon at Silicon
                  Valley '16 as a data scientist. The challenge was to
                  create the innovative fleet management system within 24
                  hours. I worked with people whom I met for the first
                  time on site and successfully delivered the smart fleet
                  management PoC. We decided to implement the future
                  vision of fleet management based on the core battery
                  prediction functionality. This prediction would be
                  accurately conducted by machine leanring using IoT data
                  and CAN data. Using this prediction, we proposed the new
                  smart fleet system with 1. smart route planning,
                  2. real-time navigation feedback.

	          <b>Q. How to improve EV's battery prediction accuracy?</b>
                  
                  <br>
                  In general, stopping by charging stations is a loss in
                  fleet management businesses. However, when planning the
                  route, it looks like hard to predict battery
                  consumption. (Based on my experience using Nissan Leaf
                  for more than one year, the battery prediction
                  functionality does not count the characteristics of road
                  and can not accurately predict battery consumption.) I
                  think this is because many factors affect EV's battery
                  performance such as the weight of the cargo, weather,
                  temperature, route (gradient of terrain, traffic), time
                  and how you drive.  What if all of these factors are
                  available through IoT sensors? The prediction
                  performance should be dramatically improved!

                  There are many use cases using battery prediction
	          though, we decided to focus on two functions : 1. smart

                  Every car has different battery capacity and remaining
                  battery. Each of drivers has different driving behavior.
                  Depending on the combination of the driver and the car,
                  the best routing path may differ. Some routes require
                  the driver to drop by charging station. Some routes
                  should be the most energy efficient route to avoid
                  dropping by charging station. Some routes should be the
                  fastest route due to Amazon Prime. Using battery
                  prediction, the combination of car, driver and route
                  can be optimally matched.

                  The fleet manager should want to have the real-time
                  monitoring tool to see each driver's performance.  This
                  tool visualizes the battery prediction and current
                  value. While some driver follows original planning of
                  the battery use, the other drivers may not be able to

                  Our team, FleetWise, won the 2nd prize in this
                  hackathon. It was very nice to meet new people, discuss
                  the challenges in this industry and think about
                  something new in the IoT and Automotice Era.

                  <br>
                  In future, once tremendous data of CAN data and IoT data
                  are collected, we can create the knowledge base of the
                  fuel consumption map. Like the traffic information is
                  attributed to edges of road network, I think the battery
                  consumption level can be added to the edges too. Using
                  this knowledge base, my leaf can be wiser too. :D
