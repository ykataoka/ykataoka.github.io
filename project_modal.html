	      <h6>Overview</h6>
	      Prius Challenge was the racing competition about
	      maximizing mpg for Prius by data-driven strategy.  This
	      involves both data science(theory) and real driving
	      skills(practice).

	      I applied both two different machine learning approaches
	      to identify the best strategy to achieve higher mpg. The
	      analysis revealed, for example, where to use
	      'neutral'/'drive' or 'EVmode(on/off)'.

	      As a result, our team got the award of 'Best MPG by
	      Machine Learning'! Plus, we achieved 83mpg(w/o
	      penalties), while Toyota dream team did 86mpg. Yeah, we
	      were so close and I can say data-driven approach worked!
	      
	      This competition was held at Sonoma Raceway by Toyota
	      Research Institute in Mar 3rd, 2017. Our team was
	      composed of me(data scientist) and 4 other members of
	      great drivers!

	      <h6>Problems</h6>
	      <b>Q1. How do we identify best strategy to maximize mpg?</b>
	      Given the dataset, it is required to identify how use inputs (throttle, brake, gear and EV-mode)

	      <br>
	      
	      <b>Q2. How does data scientist deliver the strategy to drivers?</b>
	      This is not only data analytics but also teamwork. Delivering the result to driver is key part.

	      (Sonoma Raceway has tough uphill and downhill; 47[m] height. This makes this challenge hard.)

	      <h6>Solution</h6>
	      <b>1. Comparison between high and low performance</b>

              <br>
              
              Applying clustering technique to gps information, I have
              divided the race track into 150 pieces.  Then, I
              visualized the average and variance of the 4
              inputs(gear, brake, throttle, ev-mode) using
              high-performance dataset (top 30% mpg data) and
              low-performance dataset (Bottom 30% mpg data). This
              visualization helps driver to undersntand the strategy
              of how they use 4 inputs to get higher mpg. 

              <br>
              
	      <b>2. Understanding remarkable point</b>

              <br>
                            
              Using 600 features (4inputs x 150 locations) and mpg
              data as the label, supervised learning is applied. Then,
              the feature importance is applied to identify the
              important inputs which highly affect mpg. In other
              words, they are the remakable points that drivers specially consider.

              <h6>Result</h6>

              It was an honor to recieve <b>the prize of "Best MPG by
                Machine Learning"</b> out of 20 teams! Our data-driven
              strategy was truly acknowledged by Toyota Research
              Institute.

              As for competition result, we achieved 83mpg on average
              for 9 laps(42:29).  Including unfortunate penalties, the
              score came down to 79mpg based on the regulation. In the
              end, we ended up 4th position among 20 teams.  However,
              yeah, we did great job! We were so close to Toyota dream
              team(86mpg) who are the most knowledable people about
              Prius.
