	      <h6>Overview</h6>
	      Prius Challenge was the racing competition about
	      maximizing mpg for Prius by data-driven strategy.  This
	      involves both data science(theory) and real driving
	      skills(practice).

	      I applied both two different machine learning approaches
	      to identify the best strategy to achieve higher mpg. The
	      analysis revealed, for example, where to use
	      'neutral'/'drive' or 'EVmode(on/off)'.

	      As a result, our team got the award of 'Best MPG by
	      Machine Learning'! Plus, we achieved 83mpg(w/o
	      penalties), while Toyota dream team did 86mpg. Yeah, we
	      were so close and I can say data-driven approach worked!
	      
	      This competition was held at Sonoma Raceway by Toyota
	      Research Institute in Mar 3rd, 2017. Our team was
	      composed of me(data scientist) and 4 other members of
	      great drivers!

	      <h6>Problems</h6>
	      <b>Q1. How do we identify best strategy to maximize mpg?</b>
	      Given the dataset, it is required to identify how use inputs (throttle, brake, gear and EV-mode)

	      <br>
	      
	      <b>Q2. How does data scientist deliver the strategy to drivers?</b>
	      This is not only data analytics but also teamwork. Delivering the result to driver is key part.

	      (Sonoma Raceway has tough uphill and downhill; 47[m] height. This makes this challenge hard.)

	      <h6>Solution</h6>
	      <b>1. Comparison between high and low performance</b>

              <br>
              
              Applying clustering technique to gps information, I have
              divided the race track into 150 pieces.  Then, I
              visualized the average and variance of the 4
              inputs(gear, brake, throttle, ev-mode) using
              high-performance dataset (top 30% mpg data) and
              low-performance dataset (Bottom 30% mpg data). This
              visualization helps driver to undersntand the strategy
              of how they use 4 inputs to get higher mpg. 

              <br>
              
	      <b>2. Understanding remarkable point</b>

              <br>
              
              Using 600 features (4inputs x 150 locations) and mpg
              data as the label, supervised learning is applied. Then,
              the feature importance is applied to identify the
              important inputs which highly affect mpg. In other
              words, they are the remakable points that drivers specially consider.

              It was an honor to recieve <b>the prize of "Best MPG by
                Machine Learning"</b> out of 20 teams! Our data-driven
              strategy was truly acknowledged by Toyota Research
              Institute. We were fortunate to get the picture with the
              chairman of Toyota Motor Corp. and CEO of TRI.

              <br>
              As for competition result, we achieved 83mpg on average
              for 9 laps(42:29). We did great job! We were so close to
              Toyota dream team(86mpg) who are the most knowledable
              people about Prius. Overall result was 4th position
              among 20 teams because we had unfortunate penalties.

	      <h6>Overview</h6>

              This research discusses how data analytics on muscle use
              in extreme racing conditions can be conducted to find
              actionable insights for the driver One of the important
              insights is how to minimize driver’s muscle fatigue
              during a race, because IndyCar has regulations
              forbidding the use of power steering. This research
              tackles two technological challenges: 1. data validation
              on noisy signal obtained from wearable device in extreme
              condition, 2. data cultivation to find actionable
              insights for the driver from heterogeneous racing
              data. First, we propose a data quality assessment
              technique, enabling the judgment of whether data is
              reliable or not. This qualitative analysis revealed that
              the data validation method works 99.5% accuracy to
              classify data as reliable or not. Second, we propose a
              data visualization tool based on unsupervised learning
              that enables the driver or mechanics to discover useful
              feedback. We identified and demonstrated several
              actionable insights, e.g., identifying potential
              relaxation points.

	      <h6>Problems</h6>

	      The driver's challenge and data science's challenges are
	      shown in the right figure.

	      <br><br>
	      
	      Yeah, this may sound the straightforward problem
	      statement though, it was not easy to setup this problem
	      indeed.

	      First, I had f2f conversation with Tony Kanaan to
	      discuss his real challenges. (design thinking process)
	      While most of them were hard to solve due to the lack of
	      the dataset, some sounded feasible to me. Then, once I
	      started data analytics and had discussion with various
	      people, I realized the necessity of the data validation
	      process.

	      Like this project, innovation works are occasionally
	      hard to define job contents at first. To me, the hard
	      challenges of this projects are 1. clarifying the
	      problem statement and 2. collecting the unique dataset.

            <div class="col-md-6">
	      <h6>Solution</h6>

              The idea of the data validation is that the actual
              sensor data is considered as unreliable data if the
              difference betweeen actual and predicted value are
              big. The prediction model uses car-telemetry data as
              features and predict the EMG value. This aims for
              prediction model to avoid the bad effect of noisy EMG
              values.

	      <br>
	      
	      Data cultivation uses the unsupervised learning for
	      driver or mechanics to understand tremendous data in
	      more intuitive way.

	      <br>

	      In additino to data analytics, I also created data
	      visualization WebUI for them. Data validation is shown
	      in real-time dashboard and data cultivation is shown in
	      post analytics dashboard.

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <h6>Result</h6>

	      The data validation model has 99.48% accuracy to
	      classify whether the EMG sensor data is reliable or
	      unreliable. Yeah, it has good performance. (Please see
	      the details on my paper.)
	      
              <br>

	      The data cultivation identified the locations where
	      driver tends to have unstable muscle use and where
	      driver can take rest more. This may be feedback for the
	      driver to avoid muscle cramp.
	      
              <br>

	      I presented this research in MIT Sloan Sports Analytics
	      Conference and NTT R&D Forum '17. The best part is I got
	      autograph of Tony Kanaan. :D

              What is the things to which you feel affection? Do you
              have something that you are using for more than 20
              years?
              
              <br>

              I acknoledge that I am a heavy user of Amazon. It is
              extremely time/cost effective way to obtain what I need
              though, it is also very easy to dispose of them. What a
              great era of mass production and mass consumption.

              <br>
              
              However, I also feel it important to keep meaningful
              things to my life. If something you own reminds of very
              important memory in your life, they may be special for
              you and you may feel affection to it.

              <br>

              DIY is great hobby, which my father taught me (even
              through DNA, I guess). Since I was a young kid, I made
              every furnitures, toys... They are still in my parents
              house and they remind me of my childhood. DIY is not
              always cost effective and definitely not time effective
              way.  But they tend to last long and give me special
              feeling, affection.
              
              <br>

	      <h6>My lifelong speaker, maybe</h6>
              
              This time, I made speaker, the simple model of bass
              reflex. Making speaker means here is to design a box to
              maximize the performance of a speaker unit. This work
              was great and I still love them: design, texture and, of
              course, the sound quality. The color and speaker unit
              have been 'aged' and will be classical until I die. :D
              Now, I need to protect them from my baby's poking. But
              even if it is broken by accident, I am sure I will
              repair them and get more affection to it. 
              
              <br>

	      <h6>The steps</h6>
              Here is the summary of the steps
              <ol type="I">
                <li>Decide the speaker unit</li>

                Depending on the limitation of your space and the
                requirement of sound quality and your budget, you may
                want to decide the speaker unit first. If needed,
                tweeter should be added for better performance for
                high frequency sound.

                In Japanese, this place is very helpful. You may want
                to Akihabara to get feedback from the most
                knowledgable people.
                <a href="http://www.koizumi-musen.com/">Koizumi Musen
                </a>
                
                <li>Design the box</li>

                A bass reflex system (also known as a ported, vented
                box or reflex port) is a type of loudspeaker enclosure
                that uses a port (hole) or vent cut into the cabinet
                and a section of tubing or pipe affixed to the
                port. (from wikipedia) Thus, the size of the
                enclosure(bos), the hole affect the quality of the
                sound.  This should be designed depending on the
                specification of the speaker unit that you chose.

                In
                Japanese, <a href="http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~ab6s-med/NORTH/SP/bassreff.htm">
                  this site </a> may help to design the enclosure(box).

                
                <li>Go to home center and get materials</li>

                There are various woods. Every woods have different
                characteristics. Stiff is said to be better, but I
                chose the wood by the texture and my budget. You may
                want to pay attention to the direction of the grain.
                Do not forget to get the acoustical material, which
                should be attached to insider of the speaker. Plus,
                you need to get wiring cable and terminal for it.
                
                <li>Assemble the materials and paint</li> You just
                need to assemble them. I am not writing details here,
                but just create whatever you want. If you make any
                mistake, that is part of your memory and it will
                become the reason why you feel affection, maybe.
                
                <li>Test(aging)</li> Some people talk about aging. To
                me, it sounds like urban legend...  The idea of the
                aging is that the more you use the speaker, the better
                quality sound you can experience. Some people play
                music for several days, which makes the speaker unit
                adapts the design of the enclosure you designed.

                <br>
                
                However, I personally do not think my sense of hearing
                quality is good enough to distinguish very slight but
                important difference of music...

	      <h6>Overview</h6> I have played basketball since I was 6
              years old. As I love it, I joined to
	      <a href="http://www.sloansportsconference.com/activities/hackathon/">
		MIT Sloan Sports
		Analytics Hackathon
	      </a> hosted by ESPN in Mar.2017. The theme of the
              hackathon was "Measure the unmeasureable in basketball"
              such as teamwork, mentality, leadership and heart. Yeah,
              sounds very tough. This is specifically hard task as a
              data science task, because there are no ground truth of
              these factors...

	      <br>
	      
              For this hackathon, I decided to focus on 'loose ball
              detection'. In basketball, loose ball is the moment
              audience can fell player's fighting spirits. Not only
              that, chasing loose ball has chance to 1. excite
              audience, 2. inspire teammates and 3. change momentum of
              the game.
	      <br>
              
              Conventionally in the given dataset by ESPN (as far as I
              thoroughly surveyed), the loose ball has not been
              recorded unless it is related to foul. Thus, finding
              loose ball automatically would be helpful to understand
              player's latent power of mentality.

	      <b>Q. How is it possible to detect loose ball?</b>
	      Chasing loose ball could be one of the important actions
	      to tell player's fighting spirits. However, the loose
	      ball is not recorded in stats. Moreover, there may not
	      be well-defined definition of loose ball in literature.

	      <br>
	      
	      The given dataset includes the both ball and players
	      trajectory. Thus, the challenge is how to define the
	      loose ball in mathematical formulation.

            <div class="col-md-6">
	      <h6>Solution</h6>

	      The left figure desribes my approach to detect loose
	      ball.  Based on observational definittion, the
	      mathematical formulation was set up. If the trajectory
	      data satisfies all of the conditions at certain moment,
	      then the moment can be the time somebody is chasing
	      loose ball.

	      <br>

	      Now, this is a merely heuristic approach. Once the
	      labeled data of loose ball is available, I should apply
	      the supervised learning appoach. Maybe, this is typical
	      type of deep learning task!

              <h6>Result</h6>

	      Based on the above rule-based approach, the right movie
	      shows one of the example of the loose ball. Here, you can see
	      two of each team members chase the ball.

	      There are 180+ applicants to this hackathon, and I was
	      chosen for the 40 participants! Unfortunately, I could
	      not make it to finalist this time. (First time to miss
	      the award in hackathon!) It looked like the host, ESPN,
	      wanted to know more creative idea, not cool software
	      implementation. I learned that competing sports industry
	      is very hard unless you have really deep knowledge about
	      that sports. Even though my hobby is basketball, my
	      creativity about basketball may not be enough to satisfy
	      ESPN.
