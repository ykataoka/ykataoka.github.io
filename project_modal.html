	      <h6>Overview</h6>
	      Prius Challenge was the racing competition about
	      maximizing mpg for Prius by data-driven strategy.  This
	      involves both data science(theory) and real driving
	      skills(practice).

	      I applied both two different machine learning approaches
	      to identify the best strategy to achieve higher mpg. The
	      analysis revealed, for example, where to use
	      'neutral'/'drive' or 'EVmode(on/off)'.

	      As a result, our team got the award of 'Best MPG by
	      Machine Learning'! Plus, we achieved 83mpg(w/o
	      penalties), while Toyota dream team did 86mpg. Yeah, we
	      were so close and I can say data-driven approach worked!
	      
	      This competition was held at Sonoma Raceway by Toyota
	      Research Institute in Mar 3rd, 2017. Our team was
	      composed of me(data scientist) and 4 other members of
	      great drivers!

	      <b>Q1. How do we identify best strategy to maximize mpg?</b>
	      Given the dataset, it is required to identify how use inputs (throttle, brake, gear and EV-mode)

	      <br>
	      
	      <b>Q2. How does data scientist deliver the strategy to drivers?</b>
	      This is not only data analytics but also teamwork. Delivering the result to driver is key part.

              <br>
              
              Applying clustering technique to gps information, I have
              divided the race track into 150 pieces.  Then, I
              visualized the average and variance of the 4
              inputs(gear, brake, throttle, ev-mode) using
              high-performance dataset (top 30% mpg data) and
              low-performance dataset (Bottom 30% mpg data). This
              visualization helps driver to undersntand the strategy

              <br>
                            
              Using 600 features (4inputs x 150 locations) and mpg
              data as the label, supervised learning is applied. Then,
              the feature importance is applied to identify the
              important inputs which highly affect mpg. In other
              words, they are the remakable points that drivers specially consider.

              What is the things to which you feel affection? Do you
              have something that you are using for more than 20
              years?
              
              <br>

              I acknoledge that I am a heavy user of Amazon. It is
              extremely time/cost effective way to obtain what I need
              though, it is also very easy to dispose of them. What a
              great era of mass production and mass consumption.

              <br>
              
              However, I also feel it important to keep meaningful
              things to my life. If something you own reminds of very
              important memory in your life, they may be special for
              you and you may feel affection to it.

              <br>

              DIY is great hobby, which my father taught me (even
              through DNA, I guess). Since I was a young kid, I made
              every furnitures, toys... They are still in my parents
              house and they remind me of my childhood. DIY is not
              always cost effective and definitely not time effective
              way.  But they tend to last long and give me special
              feeling, affection.
              
              <br>

	      <h6>My lifelong speaker, maybe</h6>
              
              This time, I made speaker, the simple model of bass
              reflex. Making speaker means here is to design a box to
              maximize the performance of a speaker unit. This work
              was great and I still love them: design, texture and, of
              course, the sound quality. The color and speaker unit
              have been 'aged' and will be classical until I die. :D
              Now, I need to protect them from my baby's poking. But
              even if it is broken by accident, I am sure I will
              repair them and get more affection to it. 
              
              <br>

	      <h6>The steps</h6>
              Here is the summary of the steps
              <ol type="I">
                <li>Decide the speaker unit</li>

                Depending on the limitation of your space and the
                requirement of sound quality and your budget, you may
                want to decide the speaker unit first. If needed,
                tweeter should be added for better performance for
                high frequency sound.

                In Japanese, this place is very helpful. You may want
                to Akihabara to get feedback from the most
                knowledgable people.
                <a href="http://www.koizumi-musen.com/">Koizumi Musen
                </a>
                
                <li>Design the box</li>

                A bass reflex system (also known as a ported, vented
                box or reflex port) is a type of loudspeaker enclosure
                that uses a port (hole) or vent cut into the cabinet
                and a section of tubing or pipe affixed to the
                port. (from wikipedia) Thus, the size of the
                enclosure(bos), the hole affect the quality of the
                sound.  This should be designed depending on the
                specification of the speaker unit that you chose.

                In
                Japanese, <a href="http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~ab6s-med/NORTH/SP/bassreff.htm">
                this site </a> may help to design the enclosure(box).

                
                <li>Go to home center and get materials</li>

                There are various woods. Every woods have different
                characteristics. Stiff is said to be better, but I
                chose the wood by the texture and my budget. You may
                want to pay attention to the direction of the grain.
                Do not forget to get the acoustical material, which
                should be attached to insider of the speaker. Plus,
                you need to get wiring cable and terminal for it.
                                
                <li>Assemble the materials and paint</li> You just
                need to assemble them. I am not writing details here,
                but just create whatever you want. If you make any
                mistake, that is part of your memory and it will
                become the reason why you feel affection, maybe.
                
                <li>Test(aging)</li> Some people talk about aging. To
                me, it sounds like urban legend...  The idea of the
                aging is that the more you use the speaker, the better
                quality sound you can experience. Some people play
                music for several days, which makes the speaker unit
                adapts the design of the enclosure you designed.

                <br>
                
                However, I personally do not think my sense of hearing
                quality is good enough to distinguish very slight but
                important difference of music...

	      <h6>Overview</h6> I love basketball. I have played
              basketball since I was 6 years old.
              
              I joined to MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Hackathon hosted
              by ESPN in Mar.2017.  The theme of the hackathon was
              "Measure the unmeasureable in basketball" such as
              teamwork, mentality, leadership and heart. Yeah, sounds
              very tough. This is specifically hard task as a data
              science task, because there are no ground truth of these
              factors...

              For this hackathon, I decided to focus on 'loose ball
              detection'. In basketball, loose ball is the moment you
              can see player's fighting spirits. Not only that,
              chasing loose ball has chance to 1. excite audience,
              2. inspire teammates and 3. change momentum of the game.
              
              Conventionally in the given dataset by ESPN (as far as I
              thoroughly surveyed), the loose ball has not been
              recorded unless it is related to foul. Thus, finding
              loose ball automatically would be helpful to understand
              player's latent power of mentality.

              (Since this is one hackathon, I only spent 24~48 hours
              for this project in total.)
